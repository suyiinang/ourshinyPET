### 4.1 Data splitting
The module starts with the tab which allows user to:

[1] Select the response variable for prediction

[3] Proceed with data splitting

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Data split tab of Predictive module',out.width="95%"}
include_graphics("images/datasplit1.PNG")
```

This will then create density plot for numerical variables [4] and bar chart for categorical variables [5] with division between training and test set.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Train-test split distribution plot',out.width="95%"}
include_graphics("images/datasplit2.PNG")
```


### 4.2 Feature selection
User will be presented with 2 options for feature selection process: correlation matrix and feature selection using Random Forest and Boruta method. In the correlation matrix section, user can:

[1] Select variables of choice

[2] Select correlation method

[3] Select p-value significance criteria

[4] Produce correlation matrix

[5] Hover over matrix to view details on correlation value and p-value

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Correlation matrix tab of feature selection',out.width="95%"}
include_graphics("images/corrmatrix.PNG")
```

In the next section, user may decide to run the feature selection process by Random Forest and Boruta method using the training set created from the previous data splitting section. The plot for both methods will be displayed side by side for comparison.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Feature selection tab comparing 2 different methods',out.width="95%"}
include_graphics("images/featureselect.PNG")
```

### 4.3 Variables and recipe
Based on the result in the feature selection section, this tab allow user to filter the variables to be included in the predictive model. This can be done through the multi-input selection form [1]. This module comes with predefined data transformation steps which can be displayed by clicking on the “Prepare recipe” button [2]. This will provide user with the recipes that will be executed in data transformation prior to model training [3]. To finalise variable selections and apply the transformation steps, user can click on the “Transform variables” button [4] which will navigate the page to the next section.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Variable selection and data transformation tab',out.width="95%"}
include_graphics("images/datatrf1.PNG")
```

In this section, user will be able to check the train-test split distribution once again after variable selection.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Train-test split distribution after variable selection',out.width="95%"}
include_graphics("images/datatrf2.PNG")
```

The transformed numerical variables are also displayed for comparison, with option to select variable of interest [5].

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Transformed variables before and after comparison',out.width="95%"}
include_graphics("images/datatrf3.PNG")
```

### 4.4 Model training
To train the model, user is provided with a selection of model algorithm e.g. linear model and tree-based model. Each of the model algorithm has its own tabs which mainly comprises the following set of sections: information of the model, training result, and validation result.

#### 4.4.1	Model information

This section provides background of the model that is going to be trained. External source is given in hyperlink for user to learn more information about the model [1].

##### A. Training linear model

User can proceed with model training by clicking the “Train model” button [2].

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Model information page and training',out.width="95%"}
include_graphics("images/mdltrain1.PNG")
```

##### B. Training other models

Other models (Generalised Linear Model, Decision tree, Random Forest, and Boosted Tree) require cross validation (CV) training sets. Prior to model training, user will be required to:

[1] Navigate to the “Cross Validation” page

[2] Select K-fold cross validation parameter

[3] Prepare cross validation training set

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='K-fold cross validation preparation',out.width="95%"}
include_graphics("images/kfold.PNG")
```

Once the CV training set is prepared, user can proceed to train the rest of the models. Note that training for these models will take some time and user will be prompted by a message which will disappear once model training is completed.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Training in progress loading page',out.width="95%"}
include_graphics("images/mdltrain2.PNG")
```

#### 4.4.2	Training result

Once model training is completed, user will be directed to the next section for the training result.

##### A.	Linear model

For linear model, the model fit result is given in a table form [1]. Interactive exploration on coefficient estimate result is possible by selecting p-value criteria [2], sorting method [3], and tooltip information [4]. User is to proceed with model validation by clicking on the “Validate model” button [5].

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Training result page of linear model',out.width="95%"}
include_graphics("images/mdltrain3.PNG")
```

##### B. Other models

The rest of the models’ training involves hyper-parameter tuning where the summary will be displayed once training is completed.

[1] The hyper-parameters are plotted and grouped according to 4 types of metric (RMSE, MAE, MAPE, Rsquared)

[2] Next, user will be able to view the best model according to the metric of choice through the dropdown menu selection.

[3] The data table below will respond to the metric selection and display the best model on top

[4] Click the “Choose best model” button to select the best model based on selected metric.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Training result page for GLM',out.width="95%"}
include_graphics("images/mdltrain4.PNG")
```

Once best model is selected, different information will be displayed depending on the model algorithm. For GLM, the coefficient estimate will be plotted and sorted according to the estimate value.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Coefficient estimate plot',out.width="95%"}
include_graphics("images/mdltrain5.PNG")
```

Tree based model will have variable importance score displayed, with additional tree visualisation for decision tree model.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Variable importance and tree visualisation',out.width="95%"}
include_graphics("images/mdltrain6.PNG")
```

#### 4.4.3 Validation result

After validation process, the predicted value will be plotted against the actual value in an Rsquare plot [1]. The calculated metric performance is also provided below the plot [2].

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Model validation result page',out.width="95%"}
include_graphics("images/mdltrain7.PNG")
```

#### 4.4.4 Prediction error

For linear model, additional section is available to explore cases with high prediction error.

[1] Select how many prediction points with highest deviation from actual value

[2] Select how many top predictors to be displayed

[3] Select p-value threshold for deciding significant predictors

[4] Plot of training data distribution as histogram, overlapped with points where prediction error is high

[5] User can single out specific point by double clicking the “id” number in the legend

[6] Details of point with high prediction error and their predictors value are displayed in a table

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Prediction error page for further exploration',out.width="95%"}
include_graphics("images/mdltrain8.PNG")
```

### 4.5 Model evaluation
To perform model evaluation, ensure that at least 1 of the model algorithms has been trained and validated through the previous sections. This section comprises 3 pages:
