# Introduction

With the explosion of affordable data storage and processing technologies, the **demand for data-driven decision-making** (DDDM) has increased significantly. Although there is an extensive range of commercial statistical tools, they are often **subscription-based** and **demand good technical knowledge** to mine and draw insights from. Therefore, it may not appeal to the average user. 

# Motivation
- Increasing demand for data analytics  
- Lack of open source tools for analytics for the average user  

Aim to Create R Shiny application to **encourage anyone and everyone to make data-based decisions effortlessly** 

# Approach

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
include_graphics("images/framework.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
include_graphics("images/modules.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
include_graphics("images/tool.png")
```

# Exploratory 
**Summary of dataset**  
- Interactive table allows selection and filter of variables 
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
include_graphics("images/explore1.png")
```

**Exploratory Geospatial Analysis**  
- Choropleth map - shows summary of listings by Singapore neighbourhood.  
- Point symbol map - shows the distribution of listings throughout Singapore.  
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
include_graphics("images/explore2.png")
```

**Exploratory and confirmatory analysis**  
1) Panel on the left allows user to seamlessly toggle between different charts.  
2) Automated statistical results based on selected variables.  
3) Interactive plots - user can select, pan, zoom and download plot.  
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
include_graphics("images/explore3.png")
```


# Text

# Predictive

# Further work
- Include a data load and wrangling function to accommodate different datasets.
- Combine text and explore module with coordinated linked views for multi-dimensional exploration.
- Predictive models currently limited to 5 models, additional models such as neural network can be included to provide user with wider model selection
